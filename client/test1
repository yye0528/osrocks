In 1 1⁄2 hours you can take one of the following routes:
Drive to the Windows Section and see some of the park’s largest arches. (Add one-half hour to stroll beneath either North Window or Double Arch.)
Drive to the Delicate Arch Viewpoint and see the world’s most famous arch, a mile distant. Stop at Wolfe Ranch on your way back and imagine what it would have been like to homestead this relatively barren area in the late 1800s. Three hours will give you time to do both drives. Or you could do one drive, spending ten minutes at each viewpoint along the way
empty line.
